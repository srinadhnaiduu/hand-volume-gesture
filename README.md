# 🖐️ Hand Volume Gesture Control using Python

A computer vision project that allows you to **control system volume using hand gestures**.  
This is an initial step toward building a **gesture-based smart home control system**.

## 🚀 Overview

This project uses **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **PyCaw** to detect hand movements and adjust the system's audio volume accordingly.  
By tracking the distance between your **thumb and index finger**, the program maps that distance to your system’s volume range — giving you a natural, touch-free way to control sound.

## 🎯 Features

- ✋ Real-time hand tracking using **MediaPipe Hands**
- 🔊 Dynamic volume control using finger distance
- 🧠 Intuitive visual feedback overlay
- ⚙️ Lightweight and efficient — runs smoothly on most systems
- 🧩 Easily extendable for future **smart home automation**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Libraries:**
  - `opencv-python`
  - `mediapipe`
  - `numpy`
  - `pycaw` (for Windows system audio control)
 🚧 Future Goals

## 🚧 This project is just the beginning!
Next steps include:

🏠 Integrating with IoT devices for smart home control

💡 Adding gesture recognition for lights, fans, and media systems

📱 Creating a mobile interface or voice+gesture hybrid system

☁️ Deploying on Raspberry Pi for real-world use

## 🙌 Hence
“Great products start with simple ideas — this project marks the beginning of gesture-powered smart living.”

Would you like me to add a **section for smart home expansion design** (like how to integrate this with IoT devices or Raspberry Pi next)?  
I can extend the README with that roadmap neatly formatted.
